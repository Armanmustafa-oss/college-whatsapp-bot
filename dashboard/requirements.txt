# Core Web Framework
fastapi>=0.109.0
uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0

# Data Processing & Visualization
pandas>=2.2.0
plotly>=5.18.0
# No need to pin plotly exactly unless a specific version is critical

# Database Client
supabase>=2.3.4

# Configuration
python-dotenv>=1.0.1

# Data Validation (Keep your existing Pydantic v2)

# Template Engine (Not strictly needed for the new dashboard, but keep if part of your overall project or if other parts use it)
jinja2>=3.1.3

# RAG & Embeddings (These are likely needed by the main bot application, ensure compatibility)
# ChromaDB (specify a version known to work or allow recent ones, consider the telemetry issue)
chromadb>=0.5.0  # Or a specific recent stable version. Check for versions that fix the posthog error if it persists.
# If the posthog error is very disruptive and a newer ChromaDB doesn't fix it,
# you might need to pin an older version known to work, but this is less ideal.

# Add if you use other specific logging utilities

# Testing (if pytest is used)
# pytest>=8.0.0 # Add if testing is part of this service's requirements, though often in a separate test requirements file
