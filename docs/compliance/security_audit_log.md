# Security Audit Log

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor authentication** required for admin dashboard
- **Role-based access control** (Admin, Analyst, Viewer)
- **IP whitelisting** for sensitive operations
- **Session timeout** after 30 minutes of inactivity

### 2. Data Protection
- **Encryption in transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256 for database storage
- **Phone number hashing**: SHA-256 irreversible encryption
- **PII scrubbing**: Automatic removal of sensitive data before logging

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- **Real-time error tracking** with Sentry
- **Performance monitoring** with custom metrics
- **Security event logging** with audit trails
- **Anomaly detection** for unusual access patterns

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- **Regular security patches** for all dependencies
- **Container security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **Network security groups** with least-privilege access
- **DDoS protection** through Railway infrastructure
