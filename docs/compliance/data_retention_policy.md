| Conversation logs | 90 days | Automated cron job |
| User analytics | 2 years | Manual review required |
| Error logs | 365 days | Automated cleanup |
| System metrics | 5 years | Archival storage |

## Implementation Details

A scheduled job runs every Sunday at 3 AM to delete conversations older than 90 days:

```sql
