jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Use the latest Ubuntu runner

    steps:
    # 1. Check out the code from the repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Use the latest version of the checkout action

    # 2. Set up Python environment
    - name: Set up Python 3.11
      uses: actions/setup-python@v5 # Use the latest version of the setup-python action
      with:
        python-version: '3.11' # Match the runtime.txt version

    # 3. Cache dependencies to speed up subsequent runs
    - name: Cache pip dependencies
      uses: actions/cache@v4 # Use the latest version of the cache action
      with:
        path: ~/.cache/pip
        key: ${{ runner.os }}-pip-${{ hashFiles('**/requirements.txt') }}
        restore-keys: |
          ${{ runner.os }}-pip-

    # 4. Install dependencies listed in requirements.txt
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        # Install testing dependencies if not in main requirements.txt
        pip install pytest pytest-asyncio

    # 5. Create a mock .env file for tests (if needed by config)
    # This step is crucial if your config.py requires certain variables to exist,
    # even if they are not used by the tests themselves.
    # Use secrets or repository variables for sensitive values if absolutely necessary.
    # For tests, mock values are often sufficient.
    - name: Create mock .env for tests
      run: |
        echo "SUPABASE_URL=mock_url" >> .env.test
        echo "SUPABASE_KEY=mock_key" >> .env.test
        echo "GROQ_API_KEY=mock_key" >> .env.test
        echo "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=mock_sid" >> .env.test
        echo "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=mock_token" >> .env.test
        echo "TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=+1234567890" >> .env.test
        echo "ENVIRONMENT=test" >> .env.test
        # Add other necessary variables for config loading
        # Do NOT put real secrets here!

    # 6. Run the test suite using pytest
    - name: Run tests with pytest
      run: |
        # Run tests, potentially passing the mock .env location if your code reads it differently for tests
        # Example: if your code reads .env.test specifically during testing:
        # cp .env.test .env # Copy mock to .env if needed by tests
        pytest tests/ -v --tb=short # Run all tests in the tests/ directory, verbose output, short traceback

    # Optional: Upload test results as an artifact (e.g., for JUnit XML reports)
    # - name: Upload test results
    #   uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
    #   if: always() # Run even if tests fail
    #   with:
    #     name: pytest-results
    #     path: test-results.xml # Path to the XML output if generated by pytest
